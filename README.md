# Inflation Effect

ðŸ”— **Live Project:** [francisvicta.com/inflation-effect](https://francisvicta.com/inflation-effect)

## About the Project
Inflation Effect is a data-driven web app that shows how everyday items in Canada have changed in price over time, and compares those costs against Bitcoinâ€™s price history. The goal is to make inflation tangible and highlight how Bitcoin can act as a hedge against rising costs.

I sourced public datasets (Numbeo, Statistics Canada, press releases, and other open data) and carefully cleaned them for consistency. Using these, I designed a **PostgreSQL schema**, built a **backend API** to serve historical price and Bitcoin data, and created a **frontend** that presents the data in a swipe-based slide experience.

## How It Works
1. **Data Collection & Cleaning**  
   - Everyday goods and services (food, rent, transport, tech, etc.) were compiled from public sources.  
   - Missing years were filled with linear interpolation and modest projections.  
   - Bitcoin monthly prices were included for context.

2. **Database Design**  
   - PostgreSQL database with normalized tables for items, historical prices, and BTC price history. 
   - Items can store metadata such as category, unit, and optional image URLs.

3. **Backend**  
   - REST API built to query items and serve pre-processed datasets.  
   - Powers the frontend with inflation comparisons in CAD vs BTC.

4. **Frontend**  
   - React/Tailwind single-page application with swipeable slides.  
   - Some slides compares the past, present, and projected cost of an item in both fiat and Bitcoin terms.  
   - Deployed to [francisvicta.com/inflation-effect](https://francisvicta.com/inflation-effect).
